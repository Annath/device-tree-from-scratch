# Device Trees, from Scratch

This is intended as a guide to developers who want to learn and understand devices trees on both a technical and conceptual level (i.e. me). I'm going into
writing this with a basic understanding of device trees in the context of the Linux kernel, but I'd like to learn more about the format and its applications
from the ground up, and how I could use it in my own projects. I'm going to attempt to create a guide, here, that outlines all of this information as part
of my own learning process.

Additionally, I'm going to develop example projects and sample code that myself and readers both can use to experiment with device trees.
